This is to rename anime episodes

This app's main function is to rename the anime episode files names from their original names to the names given to them by the publishers.This is so that you can get more context on what you can expect in the particular epiosde that you are watching and it can sometimes be a spolier for that episode for now this app only lets you rename the file name but in future this will also tell if a anime episode is a filler episode or not within its file name so that you can skip the episodes which are not canon if you want to.


The Prerequsites

you are given four fields which are essential for this app to work they are the The id of your anime from the myanimelist website , the starting episode number that you want to rename from , the ending episode number that you want to rename last , and lastly the directory/folder in which the anime episodes are stored in

The uses of each of the fields are 
1. The anime id from the myanimelist website : This is so that we can use a API and fetch the epiosode names of the desired anime
2. The Starting episode number : This is so that we know what episode we need to start from and fetch the the episode names from that
3. The Ending episode number : This is so that we know the last episode number we can the end the fecthing of episode names with
4. Directory : This is to know what directory the files are stored in and can rename the file names of the episodes (Note : Make sure that the anime episodes are stored in a seperate directory and does not contain anyhting other than the anime episodes)


How to use:

I Agree that it is not the most user friendly UI so this the process you need to follow to use the app

First off go to https://www.myanimelist.com and search for the anime that you want to rename and open the desired anime. This would be the normal url of your anime "https://myanimelist.net/anime/269/Bleach" out of this url what you need is the number "269" this will be entered into the id field in the app

In the second field you can just enter the staring number of the anime episode for example you have the anime episodes from 1 to 13 
then you would enter the number "1" in the second field and the Number "13" in the third field of the app

At last click the browse button and select the directory where the anime is stored in.


After Entering values in all the fields just click Rename button and wait for a sometime (time depends on the number of episodes that have to rename) and if you check the folder after the app completes its process then you can see that all the names of the anime has been renamed.
